## 📝 Step 4: Daily Workflow - Making Changes

### Open Your Project

2. **Open in VSCode**: Repository → Open in Visual Studio Code
3. **Or**: Repository → Show in Explorer/Finder

### Make Your Changes

2. **Changes Tab**: You'll see your new/modified files listed
3. **Diff View**: Click a file to see exactly what changed (green = added, red = removed)

---

## 💾 Step 5: Commit Your Changes

### What is a Commit?
Think of a commit as taking a "snapshot" of your work at a specific point in time.

### How to Commit
1. **Review Changes**: Make sure all your files are listed
2. **Summary**: Add a short description (e.g., "Completed Day 1 Assignment Q1")
3. **Description** (optional): Add more details about what you did
4. **Commit**: Click "Commit to main"

### Good Commit Message Examples:
- ✅ "Completed Day 1 Assignment Q1 - Number table program"
- ✅ "Fixed bug in Day 2 Q3 - List sorting"
- ✅ "Added comments to Day 1 solutions"
- ❌ "stuff" (not descriptive)
- ❌ "asdf" (not helpful)

## 🚀 Step 6: Push to GitHub

### What is Pushing?
Pushing uploads your local commits to GitHub so others can see your work.

### How to Push
1. **After Committing**: You'll see "Push origin" button
2. **Click**: "Push origin"
3. **Wait**: GitHub Desktop uploads your changes
4. **Success**: Your changes are now on GitHub!

### View on GitHub
1. **Repository**: Repository → View on GitHub
2. **Check**: Your changes should be visible on github.com

---

## 🔄 Step 7: Stay Updated (Sync Changes)

### When to Sync
When Harshal adds new course content or fixes, you'll want to get those updates.

### How to Sync
1. **Check for Updates**: Branch → "Merge into current branch"
2. **Choose Upstream**: Look for "upstream/main" in the list
3. **Merge**: Click to merge Harshal's updates into your fork
4. **Push**: Push the merged changes to your GitHub fork

### Alternative Method
1. **Repository**: Repository → Repository Settings
2. **Remote**: Add upstream remote: `https://github.com/harshalmore31/cdac_python.git`
3. **Fetch**: Branch → Fetch and merge from upstream

## 💡 Pro Tips for GitHub Desktop

### Efficiency Tips:
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - `Ctrl+Shift+A`: Open in VSCode
   - `Ctrl+Shift+F`: Open in File Explorer
   - `Ctrl+Enter`: Commit changes
   - `Ctrl+P`: Push to origin

2. **Commit Often**: Small, frequent commits are better than large ones

3. **Descriptive Messages**: Your future self will thank you!

4. **Review Before Committing**: Always check the diff to make sure you're committing what you intend

### Organization Tips:
1. **One Feature Per Commit**: Don't mix multiple assignments in one commit
2. **Check File Status**: Make sure you're not committing unnecessary files
3. **Use .gitignore**: Ignore temporary files (GitHub Desktop handles this automatically)

## 🆘 Common Issues and Solutions

### "Repository not found"
- **Cause**: You might be looking at the original repo instead of your fork
- **Solution**: Make sure you forked the repository first, then clone YOUR fork

### "Authentication failed"
- **Cause**: GitHub Desktop lost connection to your account
- **Solution**: File → Options → Accounts → Sign out and sign back in

### "Merge conflicts"
- **Cause**: You and Harshal modified the same file
- **Solution**: GitHub Desktop will guide you through resolving conflicts

### "Push rejected"
- **Cause**: Someone else (usually Harshal) made changes since your last pull
- **Solution**: Fetch and merge first, then push again

### "Can't see my changes on GitHub"
- **Cause**: You committed but didn't push
- **Solution**: Click "Push origin" to upload your commits
